The Rover is an obstacle avoidance robot. It just runs full steam ahead until it detects an obstacle in its path at which point it turns and then continues to move forward. The Rover is built on a Raspberry Pi 2 running Microsoft Windows IoT Core. A full description of the project along with a parts list and assembly instructions can be found at http://www.hackster.io/peejster/rover
